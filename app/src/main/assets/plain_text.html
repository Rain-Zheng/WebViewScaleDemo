        JavaScript is a <span></span>, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented,
        imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles. Read more <span></span>.</p>

    <p>This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web pages or
        other host environments. For information about <span></span> specifics to Web pages, please see <span></span>
        and <span></span>.</p>

    <p>The standard for JavaScript is <span></span>. As of 2012, all <span></span> fully support ECMAScript 5.1. Older
        browsers support at least ECMAScript 3. On June 17, 2015, <span></span> published the sixth major version of
        ECMAScript, which is officially called ECMAScript 2015, and was initially referred to as ECMAScript 6 or ES6.
        Since then, ECMAScript standards are on yearly release cycles. This documentation refers to the latest draft
